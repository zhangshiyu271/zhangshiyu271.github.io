I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Multi-Robot Planning and Control Lab](https://mrpc.aass.oru.se/), [Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS)](https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/AASS/), Ã–rebro University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Navigation, Guidance and Control from Beihang University in 2019 and Bachelor degree in Automation from Hefei University of Technology in 2014.

I am interested in enabling the robotic systems to **work in high level autonomy**, which can **flexibly react to online changes while safely working in a long term without human assistance**. It is critical for applications where the robots have to perform tasks in unpredictable and variable environments, such as exploring space and working around humans. My current research interests focus on **real-time decision-making, planning and control for robots**, especially **dealing with problems in complex real-world situations, e.g., involving multiple robots, complex tasks and uncertainties**. The underneath technologies include **modeling and efficient computation methods for complex optimization problems, safe and reliable learning**, etc.
