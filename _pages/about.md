I am an associate professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. From 2019 to 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Multi-Robot Planning and Control Lab, Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS), Ã–rebro University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Navigation, Guidance and Control from the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University in 2019 and Bachelor's degree in Automation from Hefei University of Technology in 2014.

I am interested in enabling robotic systems to work in high-level autonomy, which can flexibly react to online changes while safely working in the long term. It is critical for applications where the robots have to perform tasks in unpredictable and variable environments, such as exploring space and working around humans. My current research interests focus on real-time decision-making, planning and control for robots, especially dealing with problems in complex real-world situations, e.g., involving multiple robots, complex tasks and uncertainties. The underlying technologies include modeling and efficient computation methods for complex optimization problems, safe and reliable learning, etc.
