I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Multi-Robot Planning and Control Lab](https://mrpc.aass.oru.se/), [Centre for Applied Autonomous Sensor Systems (AASS)](https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/AASS/), Örebro University.

I am interested in enabling the robotic systems to work in high level autonomy, which can flexibly react to online changes while safely working in a long term without human assistance. It is critical for applications where the robots have to perform tasks in unpredictable and variable environments, such as exploring space and working around humans. My current research interests focus on real-time decision-making, planning and control for robots, especially dealing with problems in complex real-world situations, e.g., involving multiple robots, complex tasks and uncertainties. The underneath technologies include modeling and efficient computation methods for complex optimization problems, safe and reliable learning, etc.
